  <p>
    <strong>Dr. Marsden, ND</strong> obtained his undergraduate degree in <strong>Human Biology</strong> at the 
    <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Toronto</a> and graduated from the 
    <a href="https://www.ccnm.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine</a> in 2002.
    His path to naturopathic medicine began after witnessing the limitations of conventional treatments for complex, chronic conditions within his own family—and the potential of integrative medicine to offer more comprehensive solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    After graduation, Dr. Marsden traveled to several renowned teaching clinics and hospitals in Germany, where he observed how 
    <strong>non-conventional therapies</strong>, when integrated appropriately, significantly improved outcomes for patients with chronic disease including cancer.
    He was inspired by the growing body of research validating the clinical use of Complementary and Alternative therapies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since then, Dr. Marsden has remained committed to expanding access to evidence-informed <strong>naturopathic supportive care and integrative medicine</strong> in Canada.
    This vision culminated in the creation of the <strong>Marsden Centre for Excellence in Integrative Medicine</strong>—a modern 6,000 ft² clinic in Canada that brings together 15 providers offering collaborative care across diverse specialties.
    He runs the centre with his wife, <strong>Dr. Chaleunsouk, ND</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    An educator at heart, Dr. Marsden has spent over 15 years teaching globally in the areas of <strong>supportive cancer care, IV infusion therapy</strong>, and <strong>environmental medicine</strong>.
    He established Canada’s first post-graduate <strong>residency in cancer care</strong> affiliated with CCNM, which has trained many doctors including 
    <strong>Dr. Lei Gu, ND</strong> and <strong>Dr. Shiva Jamshidi, ND</strong>, who continue to practice at the Centre.
  </p>

  <p>
    He is also the course author and director for the 
    <a href="https://oand.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ontario Association of Naturopathic Doctors (OAND)</a> certification course in intravenous infusion therapy.
    Dr. Marsden is a highly sought-after public and professional speaker, with appearances on 
    <strong>CBC News</strong>, <strong>Marketplace</strong>, <strong>TVO</strong>, <strong>National Post</strong>, and more.
  </p>

  <p>
    He is also a dedicated researcher—conducting clinical research at the Centre with his fellows and consulting on advisory boards.
    Dr. Marsden has held leadership roles such as executive board member of the OAND and chair of the <strong>Principle of Practice Committee</strong> for the 
    <a href="https://oncanp.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oncology Association of Naturopathic Physicians</a>.
    In this role, he helped publish the first <strong>Principles of Care guidelines in naturopathic oncology</strong> in 
    <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/curroncol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Current Oncology</a> (2019).
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, he serves on the medical advisory board for the 
    <a href="https://ccran.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colorectal Cancer Resource and Advocacy Network (CCRAN)</a>, supporting those impacted by colorectal cancer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of his clinical and academic commitments, Dr. Marsden is a devoted father of two. He enjoys being in nature—hiking, sailing, camping, and relaxing by the water.
    He’s also been a volunteer basketball coach for over 10 years at the <strong>Toronto Waldorf School</strong> in Vaughan, Ontario.

      "NDs and integrative practitioners in general practice aim to support the whole person, not just the diagnosis. This series focuses on helping patients with a cancer diagnosis optimize their overall health and well-being, rather than offering direct cancer treatment. Cancer patients often have distinct needs that require informed, compassionate care. This series is designed to make you an 'oncology-informed' provider. Our expert panel will address the most common questions that arise in primary care, equipping you with the knowledge and tools to confidently support your patients through every stage of their journey.",
